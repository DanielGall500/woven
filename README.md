# Word-Order Variation Encoder (WOVEN)
## Improving L2 Structure Comprehension with SHAP-based Explainability

#### NMT Model BLEU Score
The WOVEN NMT model achieved a BLEU score of 31. This falls into the range of ‘understandable to good translations’, and achieves what I set out to do in this phase of the project: create a model which achieves reasonable but not necessarily great translation accuracy using a well-defined metric. Note that this score would likely be somewhat higher if multiple reference sentences were used for each single source sentence, however in this case we limited our score in that respect in order to fall in line with WMT20 standards. The n-gram precision scores can be seen below.
